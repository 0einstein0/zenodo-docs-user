# Privacy policy
<hr />

The Zenodo collaboration does not track, collect or retain personal information from users of Zenodo, except as otherwise provided herein. In order to enhance Zenodo and monitor traffic, non-personal information such as IP addresses and cookies may be tracked and retained, as well as log files shared in aggregation with other community services (in particular OpenAIREplus partners). User provided information, like corrections of metadata or paper claims, will be integrated into the database without displaying its source and may be shared with other services.

Zenodo will take all reasonable measures to protect the privacy of its users and to resist service interruptions, intentional attacks, or other events that may compromise the security of the Zenodo website.

If you have any questions about the Zenodo privacy policy, please [contact us](https://zenodo.org/support).

## How is your data used

Each service at CERN is responsible for compiling its own Privacy Notice regarding the data it processes.

This Privacy Notice is part of [CERNâ€™s Layered Privacy Notice](https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal?id=layered_privacy_notice) and details the processing that is unique to Zenodo. It does not address processing by other services on which this service may rely and which have their own Privacy Notice.

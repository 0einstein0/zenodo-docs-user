### News
##### Pilot of new EU Open Research Repository launched
The European Commission and CERN today initiated a pilot for the new <a href="http://zenodo.org/communities/eu/">EU Open Research Repository</a>, which is designed to include research outputs—such as data, software, posters, presentations, and project deliverables—originating from one of the EU’s research and innovation funding programs, including Horizon Europe and Euratom.

##### Documentation updates: FAQ

We've reorganized and updated our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) documentation to make it more easily searchable. Check out the updated FAQ at <a href="https://support.zenodo.org/help/">https://support.zenodo.org/help/</a> and share your feedback with us. Don't hesitate to let us know If there's any question you'd like answered there.

##### Domain-specific fields (Biodiversity)
We've made new domain-specific fields available in the upload form. These fields have long been available in our API as part of our collaboration with the Biodiversity Literature Repository, but only recently have we made them generally available in the upload form for everyone to use. The fields allow you to add and search DarwinCore metadata terms on Zenodo, so you can e.g. search for records related to a specific museum collection via the collection code field. You can see examples of the new fields on e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10824976">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10824976</a>. In addition we have improved display of records in the Biodiversity Literature Repository to show related records  - see an example on <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10824968">https://zenodo.org/records/10824968</a>. The work is part of the <a href="https://about.zenodo.org/projects/bicikl/">BICIKL</a> and <a href="https://about.zenodo.org/projects/arcadia2/">Arcadia</a> projects.


##### Integration with Software Heritage (in testing) and new software fields

We have implemented an integration between Zenodo and <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org">Software Heritage</a> which is currently undergoing testing before being launched. Among the improvements are also 3 new software specific fields which has already been made available on Zenodo: repository url, programming language, development status (see the software section in the upload form). These fields were added to align with the Codemeta standard. The developments are part of the <a href="https://about.zenodo.org/projects/faircore4eosc/">FAIRCORE4EOSC</a> project.

#### Short updates

- <a href="pdf">Roadmap</a> was updated.
- <a href="https://about.zenodo.org/projects/everse/">EVERSE</a>, a new EU-funded project we participate in, was kicked-off.

#### Webinars/events
- March 25th (webinar): <a href="https://share.openmodelingfoundation.org/2024/02/29/Workshop-3.html">OMF ModelShare on preserving and publishing computational models</a> (Zenodo, PLOS Biology and OMF)
- Jun 3-6 (conference): <a href="https://or2024.openrepositories.org/program-registration/workshops-and-tutorials/w01/">Open Repositories 2024 with InvenioRDM workshop</a>

#### Did you know?

- Zenodo-communities can have multiple members and curators of a community can edit metadata of records in their community.

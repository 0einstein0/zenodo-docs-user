Zenodo enables to share and preserve your digital research objects (publications, data, software, presentations, etc.) in three simple steps:

1. **Upload**: Upload the files you want to share.
2. **Describe**: Describe the files with minimal metadata such as title and creators.
3. **Publish**: When ready, hit the publish button to share your research.

Once you publish, we will automatically assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to your record.

#### Background

Oversight of the daily work of data management and sharing is the responsibility of the institution that originates and/or analyses, manipulates, and processes the data. In most studies and organizations, the responsible party is the principal investigator. In certain institutions, the office of research or other organizational bodies may also assist in this process. Check your organizationâ€™s data management or compliance webpages to be sure. Zenodo assumes no responsibility for oversight of data management and sharing.

#### NIH-specific guidance on Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing

**6.A:** Describe how compliance with this Plan will be monitored and managed, frequency of oversight, and by whom at your institution (e.g., titles, roles).

!!! info
    **Zenodo note:** Zenodo should not be listed as responsible for data management and sharing oversight on NIH DMSPs. Curation services may be needed as part of daily data management and sharing work, and is highly recommended for datasets you are considering depositing to this or any other repository.

Curation costs may be included as part of your grant. See the [NIH Supplement: Allowable Costs for Data Management and Sharing](https://grants-nih-gov.ezproxy.galter.northwestern.edu/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-015.html), as well as the following data management budgeting and cost estimators:
